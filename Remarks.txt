Motivation:
    The industry of education changes dramatically since the emerge of MOOC. The members of the major MOOC providers, like coursera, increase rapidly in these few years. There is no question that online course has become an alternative way to study and obtain knowledge. Then, the question is whether the MOOC will be able to replace the function of traditional education in schools. More importantly, will we be able to take advantage of big data to predict the trend of MOOC development, to locate the potential customers to join the MOOC, or to optimize the content and format of the online courses according to the preference of the members. 

Data Usage: 
     We can imagine there could be many data involved. Most directly, there must be the log files and member profiles from the major MOOC providers, which I don't know if they are available easily. On the other hand, there could be many data available which may be related to the usage of MOOC of the potential and existing members. For example, I found the American Time User Survey (ATUS) particularly interesting that it provides us the statistics of daily time spent of American for these 10 years. Thus, we may be able to estimate the average hours spent to attend classes and certificate among different groups of American, so that we can find out the group who are most likely interesting to join the MOOC, or we may adjust the difficulties and required-study-time of the online courses according to the user preferences. In addition, data related to network usage, such as the Amazon purchase log, may also be very informative to identify the potential MOOC users who may be heavy network users, and/or who bought courses-related books. However, as the first step, I will only focus on the ATUS data, and try to examine the average study time spend weekly for different groups of American. 

What I have done:
    * I found the ATUS data from the website: http://www.bls.gov/tus/home.htm#news. For demonstration purpose, I only downloaded the activity summary file in 2012. Using the data, I could identify the candidate's sexuality, martial status, age, income, employee, highest education, along with the time spend of different activities, which include the class: "Education: Taking class for degree, certification, or licensure". 
    * After a few data exploratory, I decided to group the candidates according to their age, sexuality, and education level, and examine the correlation with the time-spent for study. 

Result:
    *plt1 (https://github.com/chengjiun/ATUS/blob/master/plt1_age.png):  The plot shows the average (left) and the 95% quantile (right) of the weekly time spent of different age and sexuality group of American. Basically, we found that the time spent for studying drops quickly after people leave schools, and female seem to have more time for study. For people elder than 25, the average time of study are less than 2 hours per week, which indicates the requirement of normal online course (usually needs 3-4 hours per week at least) are difficult to reach. However, if  the online courses are focused enough to attract the top 5% of people, there should still be many people (with age > 25) who are willing to spend more than 10 hours per week. 
The most interesting thing in this plot I think is in general female are willing to spend more time studying. Therefore, we may be benefited to open more female-orientated courses, and focus on the potential female MOOC learners. 
   * plt2  (https://github.com/chengjiun/ATUS/blob/master/plt2_phd.png): Following the result of plt1, we may ask a question that if females are more interesting investing themself on studying and certificate, would it be possible to find more skilled females who are willing to learn. Since we know that data science desperately need more female analysts, these data may show that they are really many qualified female in the society who just need to be found out. Therefore, I tried to limit the analysis for whom have PhD degree, and estimate the average study time again. This is not very successful, because of the scarcity of PhD. However, the trend shows that, on the average, PhDs (he or she) do not spend too much time on studying and certificates. Note that these are for studying beyond daily work, so that my result does not suggest PhDs in academy do not concentrate on research. Although more data is required to obtain a more statistical meaningful result, this plot may imply that it would be difficult to find skilled female (also male) who are able to learn new technology, such as big-data analysis. 

Final Remarks:
    I spent much more time than required to study this subject in these two days. It seems to be very interesting, and there are many intermediate aspects that I could improve the analysis. For example, I should separate the candidates according to if they are still students or not. The trend shows in the plt1 may simply suggest females stay in schools longer. In addition, I could compare the trends in different years. Even more, the data may help us to find out the important factor to cause people out of job, and eventually help them to find jobs if they want.
